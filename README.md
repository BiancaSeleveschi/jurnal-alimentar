With the food diary app I developed, users can effortlessly add and organize food items, ensuring an accurate record of their dietary intake. The app allows users to input details such as the name of the food, its category, and nutritional information including calories and price.

One of the key features of the app is the ability to filter food items based on specific criteria. Users can easily refine their search by selecting filters such as price range and calorie range, enabling them to make informed decisions about their food choices.

The app was built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, leveraging the capabilities of Replit as the development environment. The intuitive user interface and responsive design make it easy for users to navigate and interact with the app seamlessly.

By utilizing the power of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, the app provides a reliable and efficient tool for users to manage their food diary effectively.
